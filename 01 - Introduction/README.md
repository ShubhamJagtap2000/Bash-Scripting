# Intro to Bash Scripting

# What is Bash?

- Bash is a ***scripting*** language that runs within the terminal on most Linux distros, as well as MacOS. 

- Shell scripts are a sequence of bash commands within a file, combined together to achieve more complex tasks than simple ***one-liner*** and are especially useful when it comes to automating sysadmin tasks such as backups.
